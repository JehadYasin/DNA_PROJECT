# DNA_Toolkit

main.py is the main application file

The program takes a DNA sequence as an input and is used to produce several results including:
  - GC content calculations and graphical visualization using matplotlib
  - Basic DNA sequence statistics
  - Transcript RNA sequence
  - Display of double-stranded structure
  - Amino acid sequence encoded by the sequence (Assuming it is a coding region)
  - A CSV file containing graphing coordinates
